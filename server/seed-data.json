Partner military and security forces have increased interoperability and capacity, enabling meaningful contributions to interdiction, cyber defense, border security, and DSCA/HA-DR missions.\n\n6. Homeland defense and DSCA readiness are strengthened, with Canada and Mexico integrated into planning and sensor networks, and regional partners supporting early warning and crisis response.\n\n7.

Multinational interdiction forces operate from a common targeting cycle, guided by the COP, producing synchronized maritime and air interdiction effects.\n\n5. Cyber and space-based sensing are integrated into interdiction—cyber threat indicators, satellite AIS/SAR, commercial imagery, and RF signatures cue joint operations.\n\n6.

Domain awareness architecture remains resilient under stress, including Venezuelan-driven crises, proxy activity, cyber attacks, or attempts at maritime/air evasion.\n\n10.
